~whenever i find myself growing grim about the mouth;  whenever it is a
damp, drizzly november in my soul; whenever i find myself involuntarily
pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every
funeral i meet;  and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand
of me that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from
deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's
hats off--then i account it high time to get to sea as soon as i can.  
this is my substitute for pistol and ball.~

part a^^

i know what you're thinking.  and your wrong.  i'm not obsessed with doom. 
true, i do enjoy playing the game, but i carry a (double barrel) shotgun
around for my protection.  and the protection of the one's i love. 
really.  it's true.  i'm just your average student packing a concealed
weapon.  there's got a be a thousand of them.  it's just a coincidence
that i bought my weapon the day after doom two was released the by masters
of vee arr, id.^^

my room mate is bothering me.  i hate listening to him talk to his girl
friend.  i hate listening to him and his friends talking about getting
drunk.  i hate that smelly thing he keeps in his closet.  yuck!^^

he enters.  hare i am trying to sleep and he isn't even considerate enough
to be quiet.  he stumbles around with very little control.  i tell him
he's drunk.  he's getting a little fiesty.  out of control.  he threatens
me.  i tell him to go to sleep and get over it.^^

he pulls me out of bed.  i fall to the ground.  he's pissing me off.  good
thing chose a hand spot for my shot gun.  i pull the weapon from
underneath the bed and hit him with the blunt handle.  i check to see it's
loaded and pump once.^^

get the fuck outa my room now!  i order this slob.  he lies on the floor
in agony and anger.^^

~no fucking way!~  he answers as he rushes toward me.  it's too easy.  i
pull the trigger.  the blast radius is large.  he falls to the ground, not
looking like himself any more.^^

i hear someone knocking on the door.  it's my resident assistant.  she
speaks ever so sweetly asking what's going on.  i open the door.  she sees
me.  she is surprised.  i see fear in her eyes.  she sees my weapon.  she
sees my dead room mate.  she is crying now.  she is begging for her life. 
this is sickening it's just too easy.  i'm sick of all of this.^^

i shoot again.  she falls to the floor lifeless, and i walk down the
stairs headed for outside.  i find a phone and call up my best friend.  
what are you doing?  i ask him.  ~nothing.~ let's hang out eh?  ~ok.~^^

we meet at the movie theater, like usual.  he's looking like he usually
does.  perfect.  and me?  i'm a worthless fucking 4.7.^^

good morning.  i have a gun.  don't make any sudden moves.  he
understands and obeys.  this wasn't really planned, it was something i
thought of doing, but it just wasn't really going to happen.  not in real
life.  good thing I have the southwest tickets to get home.  and the will
to use my weapon.^^";

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Global PointMessage2 = "~where are we going?~ he asks me.  shut up and
walk. i'll need to find a car or something, to get to phoenix.  damn it
all.  being a poor student sucks.  i find one that will do.  i find a
car.  i break the window with the handle of my gun.  it's bloody from my
room mates short encounter with his head.  my friend is worried.  he
probably doesn't think i'll use this weapon of mine.  he probably doesn't
know i already have.^^

i hot wire the car.  a useful technique i picked up from my brother, the
car thief.  he was a good kid, 'till he moved to albuquerque and joined a
gang.  then he robed a guy and was gunned down by the police.  just as
well really.  he was the scum of society.^^

we are driving.  headed north.  the radio is on.  u2 one.  i hate this
fucking song.  my friend is driving, so i can smash the radio.  no
silence.  i still hear the radio.  except this time it's a woman's voice. 
it's a voice i remember.  it's mary.  i can't get her out of my head. 
damn her!^^

drive faster damn it!  we need to get there quick.  don't argue with me
either.  just do it.  her voice is loud.  i tell her to shut up.  i tell
robert to stop looking at me like that.^^

my friend's name is robert.  he and i are good friends since the second
grade, when we both had mrs. nelson for our teacher.  we managed to stay
in the same schools through the years and get to know each other.  i was
really excited when i learned he was going to the university of arizona,
like me.^^

we arrive at the airport.  this'll be a trick, because airport security
would be pretty darn bad if they didn't find my shotgun.  got to make a
plan here.^^

there's a rent-a-cop walking around.  i begin to think of a plan.  we park
the car in a tow away zone and approach the rent-a-cop.  i ask him for
directions.  he begins to talk, but i do not listen.  i punch him.  he's a
lot more solid than i thought.  he doesn't shutter at all, so i pull out
my shot gun.  that gets his attention.  fortunately, there aren't that
many people around.  the three of us head for the bathroom.  i knock the
rent-a-cop out and take his uniform.  i cuff robert.  i hope they buy
this.^^

i see mary.  she starts talking again.  only she's only saying one thing. 
one thing over and over again.  she won't shut up.  she keeps saying the
same thing.^^

FUCKING STOP CALLING ME A FUCKING 4.7!  and i shoot her.  only it's not 
her.  it was the rent-a-cop, and i imagined he was mary talking to me.  
well he's dead now.  i comment.  robert is looking more concerned now, 
but he is stuck now.  too bad for him.^^

you know, i'd never really hurt you.  not really.^^

security here is a joke.  they see my badge and assume i'm ok.  what the
hell would a rent-a-cop be doing transporting a prisoner by plane? 
trading my return ticket for a second seat is no problem, and again,
doesn't bring the suspicion it should.  why are these people stupid.  just
as well i guess.^^

we get on the plane with ease.  we have boarding passes numbered twelve
and thirteen, so we get pretty good seats.  robert is sweating.  he must
be really worried.  he should be.  well, not really i mean i would never
kill him.  i'm not really violent by nature.  i just won't be pushed
around.  that's all.^^

the plane takes off and i find my self drowsy, but i stay awake.  i must. 
i have a dr. pepper.  which is a relief.  in arizona, they have nothing
but that god awful mr. pibb, which tastes like bad medicine.  who ever
created mr. pibb should be drug out in to the street and shot.  maybe
that's what i'll do when i am done with this.^^

the voices are constant.  they are an echo of the past.  i live in the
past.  or on the edge of the past.  where some linger in the past, i live
in the past.  where others look bravely to the future, i black it out and
put it off until tomorrow.  garfield's little shoulder devil speaks to me:
tomorrow never comes.^^";

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Global PointMessage3 = "even now, as i hold his life in my hand, robert
doesn't talk to me. but they do.  and they just won't shut up!  mary, my
father, my mother, becky and mrs. nelson.  all of them are saying the
same thing.  judge jury and executioner.  once judged i am finished,
never again considered.  the day dream fades.  i return to reality.^^

the plane lands and it is late.  it is dark.  not like my first time.  it
was day light then.  we were in side and i thought for sure i had found
true love.  then later, i told mary about it.  why did i do that?  to
impress her?  why?  fuck it!  i still have to get off this damn plane.^^

~have a nice day~ she says with a smile on her cute little face, as i
leave the plane.  fuck you too.  i think to my self.  and nudge robert
forward.  i'm too tired to drive up the hill at night.  better get a room
at the motel eight.  that'll do.^^

the hills - more like mountains - of los alamos are rather beautiful.  it
will be good to see them again.  and mary.  it will be good to see her
again.  even if she doesn't want to see me.  she just wants to see this
bastard friend of mine.  fucking perfect robert.  robert and his friend
the one who has been judged.^^

we arrive by cab at the motel eight and get a room.  i secure robert for
the night.  i lay on the bed and fall asleep.  sleep doesn't come easy. 
it never does.  i go back in to the past and remember.^^

[ edited out ]^^

it is early in the morning.  robert looks at me worried.  very well.  it's
time to go.  i feel rested, but uneasy.  it was a frighteningly real
dream.  i dream in the day and i dream at night.  what crime am i guilty
of?  who did i offend?  i don't tend to believe in god.  maybe a devil? 
maybe there is no ~good or evil.~  maybe there is just hate and love. 
maybe that's all a person needs.  i call up to have a cab come around. 
this is useful, because we'll need to get up the hill somehow.^^

a guy in a yellow taxi cab drives up.  this guy looks like he belongs in
new york city.  he is smoking a cigar, and looks like he smells.  i stick
my shot gun in his face.^^

first thing your going to do is put that damn cigar out!  i command, next,
you're going to drive us to los alamos.  and your working real cheap
today.  got it?  we drive off.  i'm beginning to regret not bringing an
extra set of clothes, because these rent-a-cop's clothes are beginning to
smell like shit.  well, not like real shit, but you get the idea.^^

just like my sister when she left town.  she had come home drunk one too
many times.  she had thrown up in the living room and made enough noise to
wake father up.  he kicked her out of the house.  last i heard of her, she
was working as a hooker in san francisco.  she was always nice to me. 
being a bit of a protective older sister.  i can hear her saying it too. 
she says it as a fraction.  she always wanted to go to harvard and major
in math.  she wanted to be a fucking teacher.^^

three kids.  one ended up dead in albuquerque new mexico (better known as
three feet from nowhere).  one working in a town that probably has an
excess of those in her profession.  and me.  i'm the only one who's going
to be some one.^^";

Global PointMessage4 = "the radio is playing nine inch nails.  cool. turn
it up! it has been too long since i have listened to 107.9 the edge, my
favorite radio station, here in new mexico.  i want to fuck you like an
animal!  you make this all go away.  bow down before the one you serve.^
[ edited out ]^^

``FUCKING PIGS!'' i yell out!  the other two in the cab look at me kinda
funny like.  i guess it's sort of a strange thing to blurt out like
that.^^

we arrive in los alamos ahead of schedule.  this cab driver is fast man! 
i wouldn't want to be driving on the same street as him.  well, here i am
being driven around by him.  that's probably a lot better eh?  i guess
not.^^

i tell him where we are going which is a good thing, because he's driving
us there.  he stops in front of mary's house and i tell the two of them to
stay put.  mary's house is rather large.  nice house.  i wouldn't mind
living here, except all of the siblings running around.  i wasn't quite an
only child, but mine are dead and gone now.  one dead, the other gone,
that is.^^

i can here them calling for me.  why do they talk to me?  the same thing 
as everyone else.  over and over again.  make them go away.  i knock on 
the door.  a middle aged man answers the door.  could i see mary please?  
and with that i pull the shotgun out and pump once.^^

NOW!^^

he claims that she isn't there.  he's lying.  i can tell.^^

i hear the cab driving off.  damn it.  with that i turn around and let a
couple of shots go off.  i get a good shot at the left tire.  the driver
loses control and crashes in to a tree.  better go check on robert.  it
would be bad if he was killed.  the driver is dead.  impaled by a long
stick.  he looks like he died in agony.  just like that guy in the
beginning of radars of the lost arc, who stepped in to the light.  i get
robert out of the car.  he is worried, but alive.  he has a cut on his
forehead.  oh well.  he'll live.  hmm.  on second thought... i shoot him
in the leg to make sure he won't go running away.  he screams in agony. 
that must hurt.  like the pliars, only a few times worse.  and the pain
goes away, when you let go of the pliers.  i let him to wait in the middle
of the yard, bleeding to death.^^

on the phone.  i am on the phone.  a girl is on the other end, and all she
says is the number.  and i have some pliers in my hand.  i squeeze my
finger.  and another.  pain.  mmmmm.... feels good.  PAIN!^^

shut up!  i am back at the door and no one can be seen.  it takes me a few
minutes to find mary hiding under the living room table.  i bring her
outside and push her by robert who is bleeding all over the place by now. 
i think that my have been a mistake.  oh well.  won't be the last, i'm
sure.^^

i've brought you two together so you'll talk to each other.  i'm pretty
sick of hearing stuff from you two!^^

i begin.  she caresses robert.  worry is in her eyes.  not for me though. 
for robert.  which is just as well.  besides i'm getting use to it.^^

i hear somebody call out.  the police.  i am surrounded.  a man with a
loud speaker calls out the number.  shut up!  make that damn number go
away!  i yell out, so all can hear me.  i pump the shotgun for effect.  i
hear three shots ring out.  not from my shotgun this time.^^

silence.  it's all gone.  i can't hear anyone.  not mrs. nelson, not my 
father or mother, not mary.  no one.  i drop to my knees.  peace it's all 
gone.  everything is silent.  it fades.  silence.  peaceful silence.^^

nothing.";
