15 may 1983^^

a discharge of energy and it was all over.  john donovan arrived in his
target in time.  he was in a long room, decorated with an odd assortment
of furniture.  the place was hardly recognizable to donovan.  he had lived
here for about a year which spanned his seventh birthday.  the scummy land
lord had decided to sell the place after they rented there for a year. 
not all land lords were scummy, but this one was.^^

there was an atari sitting on the floor by the tv and donovan was watching
his new friend ralph play smurf.  annoying little blue things.  who would
write a dumb-ass game like this?  for 1983, it was top of the line.  it
required you to actually jump over fences and stuff.  this is where john
donovan would begin his changes.^^

donovan found the carpet cleaner just where one would expect it.  he
recalled this story well, though for the life of him, donovan couldn't
remember the event himself.  ralph was busy playing smurf on the atari. 
it would be easier this way.  in the original history, confrontation had
mounted between ralph and donovan.  donovan had threatened ralph with the
carpet cleaner, and ordered ralph to leave.  ralph had used a glass
dolphin as a hostage, and escaped from the house.  though they were
initially enemies, ralph and donovan would become good friends.^^

this time, ralph wouldn't have the chance.  the carpet cleaner had a
smooth black rod and an orange head was at the very end.  the blood
wouldn't be all that noticeable there.  orange, red, what's the
difference?^^

donovan raised the weapon up and swung hard.  it only took one hit.  
ralph's head went flying.  donovan continued to beat the lifeless body,
just to be sure, that ralph was quite dead.  the next thing to be done
would be to hide the body.  which would be a trick.  but donovan had the
mind of a forty six year old in the body of a six year old.  no one would
suspect a six year of murder after all.  he would wait until it was
dark.^^

there was a forest just the opposite side of the street from where donovan
and ralph lived.  he crossed the street and started walking, carrying an
old trunk.  he also brought the carpet cleaner and a shovel.  it was dark,
and difficult to see.  donovan had considered bringing a flashlight, but
what was the point?  it would just make him easier to see if any one was
looking for him.  being found with a dead body, and the murder weapon
would be bad thing.^^

finally donovan arrived at a rock outcropping in the middle of the forest. 
it was split into two main boulders.  it stood out from the trees and
bushes around.  donovan had brought the weapon, and when he wedged the
trunk between the two boulders, he put the carpet cleaner there too.  he
buried the body under a mound of dirt.^^

that was done with, it was time to use the chron-set and get out of
here.^^

memories change, a funeral.  death, an investigation.  a cover up.  lies. 
images like a black and white movie.  like he had really been there.  he
will be.  he had.  he was.  donovan became.^^";

20 august 1988^^

donovan felt his body jolt as he shifted to another time.  he was sitting
at a card table.  there was a young twelve year old boy on the opposite
side of the table.  he wore glasses and a real shirt.  not a t-shirt like
his other friends wore, but a striped shirt with a collar.  between them
was a map of europe and a collection of cardboard counters.  each
represented a tank, infantry or some other piece of military hardware.  
the two of them were fighting for europe.  in the final analysis, it
didn't matter though.  in fact, this time, the whole game seemed
pointless to donovan.^^

~hey, thanan.  you want to go outside and play some tennis?~ donovan
suggested.  ~it's getting hot in here.  i think we need a break.~^^

~sounds like a good idea to me.~ thanan replied.  they walked outside and
headed to a nearby tennis court.  something had always bothered donovan
about this person.  although, donovan would invite him over and try to
spend time with him, he found that thanan lived in fear of his mother, who
didn't like donovan very much.^^

it wasn't his fault.  in fact it didn't matter, but donovan knew that he
should have said something.  he knew that this relationship would turn
sour, unless he did something about it.^^

~you know thanan, it's sort of annoying how we always have to play at my
house.  i mean, every once and a while, you would think we could set up a
game at your house.  or just go play outside or something.~^^

a simple statement and it all set into place a friendship which would last
forever.^^

next step, one of the most important.  donovan used the chron-set
again.^^

memories change, birthday party.  friendship, support, a mirror of the
soul.  images like a black and white movie.  like he had really been
there.  he will be.  he had.  he was.  donovan became.^^";

travel^^

donovan considered as he traveled through time.  he'd replaced a friend. 
can you do that?  donovan recalled once telling (a good, close personal) 
friend that friends, true friends should be forever.  he also recalled
that he considered ralph a true friend at one time.  he'd even told him
so, but ralph had shrugged it off like it was nothing.^^";

part     four^

14 april 1994^^

donovan was getting a headache.  he looked around, and he found a familiar
place.  it was much too familiar.  he had spent too many of his high
school years in this biology room.  At the time, donovan was interested in
biology.  thanan was on a team of five who were in the school's biology
team.  they were working on the presentation for the finals in a state
competition.^^

it was after school, and donovan had use of a car, but he had stayed
after school to spend time with his friend thanan.  donovan had come to
offer input and to make suggestions.  he felt welcome here.  for a
moment, he felt he had never left, that for twenty some years, he had
been dreaming, and now he had finally awaken.  but it was not so.  he
looked at the five members of the team and found the one that he was
looking for.^^

mary.  she was beautiful.  everything about her was perfection, and
donovan couldn't help but stare at her.  he had not seen her since he was
nineteen (which would be just over a year from now).  she was just as he
remembered her.  she didn't much want to be here.  she wanted to go home.  
donovan had to talk to her.^^

~good morning.~ he smiled.  peace entered donovan's soul he found
personal purpose for the first time in years.  he just wanted to spend
eternity in this moment.  not to move at all.  with the chron-set he
could choose any moment from his life to experience.  donovan would chose
this moment above all others to relive.^^

~uh... it's not morning.~  mary answered.^^ 

~it's morning somewhere...~ donovan was still smiling, ~like china.  I
bet it's morning there.~^^

~maybe, but we're not in china, this is new mexico.~ mary replied.^^

~you don't quite look like you really want to be here.~ donovan
observed.^^

~you are correct.  i find this whole thing rather tedious.  it was my
biology teacher's idea that i do this, even though i wasn't much
interested in it.~^^

~you want a ride home?  i bet they can do without you for the rest of the
afternoon.~  donovan asked.  everything was going exactly as it had done
before, the only reason he had jumped as early as this was because he was
enjoying this moment too much.  he didn't want it to end.^^

~sure.  that would be cool.~ mary replied.  ~hey, thanan, i'm going to go
home with... uh... what's your name?~^^

~donovan.  john donovan.~^^

~john is going to take me home.~ mary told him.^^";

Global VeracityMessage4p7 = "

~really.  hmm.  ok, see you tomorrow then.~  thanan winked at donovan as
they left.  the first time donovan had seen thanan do that, he dismissed
it as being irrelevant, now he wished he had not, but that was what this
was all about.  it was all about second chances.^^

the two of them walked outside.  it was a lovely afternoon in los alamos
new mexico.  birds chirped and the sun was bright.^^ 

~so, what year are you?~  donovan asked.  she is a freshman.^^

~i'm a senior.  i'm a senior this year, and i will be a senior for
another three years.~ mary replied.^^

~that's quite a trick.  you sure you're not a freshman?~  donovan grinned
like an idiot.  though he had spoken these words before, his body language
was completely different.  it changed the meaning of everything, even
though, he felt exactly the same way.^^

~sure.  well, sort of.  how about you?~ mary inquired.^^

~me?  i'm a junior.  it's really great.  only a year and a bit left.~^^

mary sighed.^^

~tell me.  where abouts do you live?~  donovan asked.  she lives on
baranca mesa.^^

~baranca mesa.~  mary replied.^^

~really.  hmm.  that's sort of near to where i live.  i live on north
mesa.~^^

questions continued.  donovan knew all the answers by heart.  he felt a
perverse pleasure in asking them again anyway.  it was like he was an
actor, playing a part that he loved.  they arrived at donovan's car in the
high school parking lot.  donovan drove right up to exactly the right
house.  mary didn't even notice that she didn't need to tell him where to
go.  she was looking at him, in a way that he honestly could not remember. 
she had probably done that the first time too, but he had dismissed it,
like so much else.  could have been worse.  he could have died at age
seventeen.  before she opened the car door, donovan took the opportunity
and asked the question that would be the only change he would make
here.^^

~you want to go see a movie on friday?~^^

~sure.  i would like that.~  almost a smile, and an odd (almost confused) 
look, like she had been thinking the exact same thing.^^

a warm glow surrounded donovan.^^

soon the emptiness would return.  a nagging cold on his soul.  darkness
ensued and enveloped everything in his vision.  his feelings were numbed
by despair.  he was done here.  he had gotten what he had come for.^^

he set the chron-set for the next time period.^^

memories change, a first date.  a second, and then spending all free time
with her.  images like a black and white movie.  like he had really been
there.  he will be.  he had.  he was.  donovan became.^^";

20 june 1995^^

it felt like an ice pick was tapping on his head.  the pain was becoming
worse.  he would only be able to use the chron-set a few more times.  it
was donovan's eighteenth birthday.  he had invited his friends over for
burgers and a game of ultimate frisbee.  everyone invited had shown up,
except mary.  she was going out of town, except she wasn't out of town at
all.  it was a lie.  donovan knew it.  he hadn't known it the first time
he was here, but it came as no surprise to him now.  she had lied poorly,
though because she wound up at the same place where donovan and his
friends had decided to play ultimate frisbee.^^

it was a hot summer day.  mary was on the roof of the middle school
buildings, talking to one of her friends.  donovan's party entered the
school soccer field from the far corner.^^

~look!  it's john.  you know, i think he loves you.~  becca said.^^

~i don't know.  i tend to think not.~ mary was never very confident about
relationships.  she tended to assume the worst, if a person didn't tell
her how they felt.^^

~let's go over and say hi.~  becca suggested.^^

~i don't know... i told him that i couldn't come to his party, because i
was going to be out of town.  he'll probably be mad.~^^

~come on.  you should be with him on his birthday.~^^

~very well.~  mary consented.  they climbed down from the roof at the
safest possible point.  they approached the group.  donovan looked very
serious.  in fact he was beginning to look very mad.^^

~so.  you're going to be out of town eh?~  donovan almost bothered to
make the pretense of making a question out of the statement.^^

~i'm sorry, i was going to be, but then our plans changed.~^^

~bull shit.  this is always the way.  you give me your lies, and your
half-truths.  what the hell am i suppose to believe?  anything that comes
out of your mouth is more than likely to be a lie.~ donovan accused mary
harshly.^^

~you don't understand...~  mary tried to interrupt.^^

~NO!  _you_ are the one who doesn't understand.  i don't have to put up
with this.  you can go to hell.  i don't want to ever see you again.~ 
donovan said, and began to walk away.  to be alone.  that's all he wanted
at the moment.  rage and anger overtook reason and thought.  why did i
come here?  donovan asked himself.  why this moment in time?^^

anger.  pain.  the chron-set, would take it all away, must jump again. 
like a drug.^^

memories change, depression.  masochist, meaningless sex and pointless
relationships.  images like a black and white movie.  like he had really
been there.  he will be.  he had.  he was.  donovan became.^^";

part        six^
---------------^
8 november 2002^^

the pain in his head was hardly bearable.  he had to continue though.  it
is was necessary.  donovan was a young man of twenty-six.  he was working
for mikrosoft, on some god awful project that would become nothing.  it
was all useless.  he did have the opportunity to change that though.  he
had been given a chance here, that he had never seen when he was here the
first time.^^

mikrosoft had the largest office building in seattle at this point in
time.  donovan had a small office in this large building.  actually, it
was more of a cubical, but everyone called them offices for some perverse
reason.  security was tight here.  recently, a number of hackers had been
caught trying to put viruses in mikrosoft products.  they were mostly
software pirates interested in bringing mikrosft down.  the real problem,
was they didn't have access to mikrosoft as donovan, and all the employees
here did.  although a low-level employee, he had been through a massive
security check that had been introduced recently.  the whole process had
seemed pointless at the time, and it would turn out to be, because donovan
would change everything.  he would bring them down.^^

he knew of an important project that was being developed here called
msvros.  the new virtual reality operating system.  it was problematic at
best (full of bugs and more likely than not to crash), but it would
become extremely popular with the same sort of people who liked windows
and the mac operating system.  it was late at night, and most people were
gone.  the only people around were the night watchmen and other security
types.^^

donovan picked up a laptop computer, put it into his backpack.  he found
the vent he was looking for and opened it up with the screw driver from
his swiss army knife.  he had bought it in austria.  they are cheap in
that part of europe for some reason.  he crawled into the small
passageway.  it was a tunnel that was part of a network of tunnels, that
led to all parts of the building.  all the tunnels on this level led to a
center shaft which helped circulate air through the entire building.^^

he would have to find a way to get up four floors, to the maximum security
vault where the alpha version of msvros was kept.  he tore a piece of
flimsy metal from the floor of the tunnel and fashioned a hook.  he made
another and then he was ready.  using one on each hand, he climbed up the
shaft slowly.  when he finally reached the desired floor, he kicked open
the vent.  there was no one around.  donovan was in a room with a huge
vault.  he had side stepped the human guards, which was a good thing,
because he wasn't in the mood to kill anyone.^^";

Global VeracityMessage6p5 = "

he got out his laptop computer and plugged it in.  it had a special black
market interface for this sort of thing.  donovan had bought it just for
this purpose.  it would ~listen~ to the lock using the physics of the
metal, and come up with the combination.  it was experimental, but
usually, worked in less than ten minutes.  donovan waited.^^

after a few minutes, an audio beep sounded to indicate the code had been
broken.  he read off the numbers from the color lcd computer screen and
dialed them into the lock.  a loud and very pleasing click rang out. 
donovan put the computer away in his backpack and walked in as the vault
opened.  a pentium pro was sitting on the table, all ready to be used,
completely unprotected at this point.  the outdated computer was slow, but
reliable enough for what it was mostly used for - storage.^^

donovan sat down at the computer and made the proper changes to the code. 
he put a worm in the code, that the designers would never catch.  this
modification that donovan had just introduced, would make the product not
only unusable, but extremely unpopular with any end user.^^

the code was inserted.  he was done.  one more chron-set and he would be
all done.  all will have changed.^^

memories change, a financial institution crumbles.  an opportunity for
other companies open up.  images like a black and white movie.  like he
had really been there.  he will be.  he had.  he was.  donovan
became.^^";

part    seven^

6 august 2005^^

the throbbing in donovan's head is unbearable.  he has trouble
concentrating.  he was in a meeting.  there were three other men were in
the room, all contemplating the their own future.  what would be done.  
the first time donovan had been here, he hadn't come up with anything.  
neither had his closest friend, thanan who sat on his right side.^^

this time it would be different.^^

~i know what is wrong with msvros.  i know how we can fix it.  and i know
how we can all become rich.  we'll all be bigger than phill gates.~ 
donovan pronounced.  the three executives weren't trained in this sort of
thing.  they were not business men by training, they were programmers. 
they had gotten into the business hacking out code and gave up on it. they
realized they could make more money this way.  the money had become a
drug.^^

~you men have given up.  i know.  so had i.  but, though vros failed
because of `the worm', the fundamental flaw was that mikrosoft is old. 
it's an institution.  the market needs something new, they need a fresh
approach~ donovan was a minister, preaching for his highest belief, ~they
need US!~^^

behind them, the door opened.  with the creek of the door, a man stepped
in.  he carried a rifle.  a shot gun.  his hair was frazzled and his eyes
were blood shot.  he looked like hell.  anger filled his face like an
eternal flame.  he pumped the single barrel shot gun and aimed it at
donovan.^^

donovan turned around surprised.  this wasn't the way it happened the
first time.  in fact, this had never happened at all.  this man, who
looked like the very devil had taken his soul, was phill gates iii.  he
must have figured out who was responsible for the `worm', though it was
much to late for gates to do anything about it.  mikrosoft was history
now, and so was phill gates.  well, maybe gates was grasping on with
everything he had left, which was nearly nothing.^^

~DAMN YOU!~ he screamed at donovan ~who do you think you are?!?  don't
you know who i am?  you can't do this to me!  you're going to pay.~^^

donovan cleared his throat.  he had to remain calm, and collected.  
~come on, mr. gates, i think we can talk this over reasonably without
that gun.~ donovan suggested.^^

~fuck that!  i think i'll just kill you now...  YOU BLOODY TOAD!~ he
spoke and hit donovan in the head with the `safe' end of the gun.  
donovan fell to the ground, with a big cut on his forehead.  gates backed
up and looked around.  at that moment, he looked ready.^^

~don't do it, mr. gates.~  thanan said.  he approached gates and pushed
donovan out of the way.  as if he knew, at that moment, his closest friend
would die, if he didn't act.^^

BANG!^^

another man took the weapon from gates and pounded him into
unconsciousness.  thanan lay next to donovan, blood all over the place. 
thanan had saved donovan's life.  and now, thanan was lying on the floor
by donovan, dying.^^

~thanan, why did you do it?  i... you... god... don't die...  not again!~ 
donovan cried out.  tears began to form.  the pain was mental this time. 
the headache was gone for that instant.  the moment was a mesa on a flat
plain, elevated and separated from all else in space and time.^^

~don't worry.  phill gates... he's really history now, eh?~  thanan
smiled as he dove head first into unconscious.^^

~NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!~  donovan yelled out.^^

the pain returned.  donovan's head felt as though it will explode.  the
pain was unbearable.  the chron-set is useless now, he must return.^^

memories change, a hospital.  near death for a close friend, a trial, and
imprisonment, finality.  images like a black and white movie.  like he had
really been there.  he will be.  he had.  he was.  donovan became.";
