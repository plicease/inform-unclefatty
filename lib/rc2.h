have no color prejudices or caste prejudices nor creed prejudices. indeed
i know it.  i can stand any society.  all that i care to know is that a
man is a human being -- that is enough for me; he can't be any worse.~

[01] welcome to earth^^

planet earth.  population over five billion.  every hour there are nine
hundred sixty two million broken hearts on this pathetic little planetoid
a short distance from one poorly regarded yellow star.  this is the story
of one robert cobbler, programmer and broken heart.  he had a friend by
the name of monique janet flynn, who had just told him he was cool
because of his cynical outlook on life.  robert had a crush on this very
same friend and was made so happy by this odd little statement that he
was going to finally tell her exactly how he felt.  it had been so hard
for him, to be such a lasting friend but he had some how managed it.  
the two of them were going to dinner that night and he'd tell her.  it
would be perfectly romantic.  it was quite likely that this would make up
for all of those tragic relationships (all two of them) robert had
managed somehow to survive.  just planning the whole thing out made
robert happier than he'd been in a long while.  he was actually starting
to lose his cynicism.
^       the reader might be wondering why I started off the above
paragraph with a description of the rotten little mudball you now stand
on.  after all the reader might be thinking to him or her self, ~i live
on that planet.  i know what the earth is like.~  what you might not know
is that I am actually Zalic VI and I am from the grand old planet
shashars, orbiting the beautiful star Puloc.  this of course has nothing
to do with robert cobbler, except perhaps that he is one of My better
friends.
^       actually there were more people who showed up to dinner than
robert had expected.  well perhaps it wouldn't be quite as romantic as
robert had hoped, but it could still be fun.  he meet some pretty cool
people: linda and sue who were monique's friends.  there was also a
friendly chap by the name of darek who was monique's boyfriend.  
naturally also tagging along was monique's little sister.
^       when he entered the restaurant, robert could not help but
remember how much he hated chinese food.  the six of them sat down and
got ready for dinner.  robert was asked to sit in a different location so
that monique and her boyfriend could sit together.  robert wasn't paying
attention because he was too busy drinking a tall glass of cold ice
water.  he was exceptionally thirsty, or at least exceptionally compared
to everyone else.  most people didn't drink as much liquid as robert
does.  sue moved over so that darek and monique could sit by each other
on roberts left.  the other thing odd about robert was that he ate much
faster than the average human.  it was an old family habit, unlike the
thirst which was a personal trait.  robert contemplated food consumption
habits for a good five minutes while the party rudely discussed random
other subjects.";

^       then he stopped and took a moment to wonder just exactly why
darek and monique were sitting so close to each other.  he had been
accused of being obtuse in the past and he considered it possible he was
being thusly effected.
^       ~you guys are such a cute couple.~  sue said smiling.
^       ~who?~ robert asked innocently enough.
^       ~monique and her boyfriend over there.~
^       robert somehow managed to keep his composure and stop himself
from saying ~but i haven't asked her out yet.~  this sort of multitasking
is actually easier than doing two things all at the same time because all
he had to do was not do two things at once.  thinking carefully, looked
around the table and put two and two together.  this time he got four
instead of four point seven.  robert checked his, watch which he was not
actually wearing (and in fact had not worn since some time in his early
high school career) and noted that he'd been uncynical for nearly four
hours and forty two minutes.  robert nodded to himself and said two words
before leaving the restaurant.
^       ~new record.~^^";

robert liked to listen to loud music and drink dr. pepper when he was
depressed.  for once he had neither, he was just sitting in the middle of
a dark field wondering.  the field beneath him on the other hand was
thinking: [of all the fields in the universe he had to chose me.] this
field was in a particularly bad mood because of the soccer game the
midgets had been playing this afternoon.  it wasn't bad enough, that the
kids would dig him up with their sharp cleats, but their parents would
set up there annoying tables and drink stations on the side, scarcely
even paying attention to the miserable little children.
^       robert neither knew or cared about what kind of mood the field
was in.  he concentrated on the cool summer night and wondered why it was
he was here, how many stars were in the sky, and how long it would be
before monique realized darek was an idiot and left him (robert would
deny being jealous: you can decide for yourself).  he couldn't possibly
know the answers to these questions, although shasharian scientists long
ago mapped out the known universe and have the exact figure on file in a
tall cylindrical building in the capital of shashars.^^";

two days had passed and it was now twenty eight june nineteen ninety
seven.  robert entered the bar and gazed around, confirming that there
was no one there he knew.  there was the typical bar type smell, a single
dimly lit pool table and a number of bar stools.  a rough estimate of
`older than me' was the best robert could come up with when determining
the age of everyone else in the bar.  trying desperately not to look self
conscious, robert sat down at a lonely bar stool on the lonelier end of
the bar.  he tried to look as cool as possible, keeping himself from
actively getting the tenders attention.  after about five minutes, robert
realized he hadn't gotten the tenders attention, using this passive
technique.
^       ~gimme a beer.~  robert finally requested as coarsely as he could
manage.
^       the bar tender turned slowly to robert, sized him up, and asked:
^       ~you got any i. d.?~
^       to this, robert gave a little chuckle and said ~certainly~ as he
handed over his drivers licence confidently.
^       ~says here june twenty nine, nineteen seventy six.~ the tender
announced, studying the piece of plastic the same way a scholar might
study the dead sea scrolls.  ~that would make you twenty, until
tomorrow.~
^       robert chuckled again, this time with renewed confidence and said
~ah, yes, but you see i am from australia.  right now it's one o'clock on
the twenty ninth in sydney, and that is where i was born.~
^       he searched his pocket and drew out a passport.  the bar tender
studied it too in a similar way to the licence.
^       ~yeah?  how come you don't got no accent.~  the brute questioned.
^       ~that's simple, you see, i've been living in the states for
nearly all of my life.  i moved here with my parents when i was four
years, eight months and twelve days old.~  and with that he shrugged, as
it seemed the right thing to do.
^       ~getaaaaouttaaaahere.~ said the tender, no longer smiling and
pointing to the door.
^       ~ok... well if that's the way you treat valuable customers i
think i'll just leave.~  robert announced.  as soon as he got out of the
bar, he threw the passport in the garbage.  it was a perfect fake as it
happened, but he estimated that he'd never need it again.  he had been
born in america like nearly all his friends (except me).
^       robert would have to get drunk tomorrow though he desperately
wanted to today.

monday morning was a blurry site for robert's eyes.  rubbing them while
his eye lids were closed seemed to have no effect.  he tried again to
focus on the computer console in front of him.  he had an awful headache
and even the glow of the monitor seemed to annoy him.  he'd been at work
no longer than five minutes and he was already thinking about leaving
early for the day.
^       ~hello robert.~  a cool female voice came from behind.  though to
robert it sounded like a gong placed exactly seven inches from his
pounding skull.  he held his head and said (all with body language mind
you) that he wasn't feeling very well and could you please talk a little
quieter thank you very much.
^       ~oh... did you have a few too many last night?~  she asked
mockingly.  mostly ignoring the requests robert had made.
^       robert's slow mind finally identified the female voice.  
actually it was the female face which reminded him of who she was.  
although he could not remember her name, he did vaguely recall that he
had been initially excited to learn that she would be working in his
general vicinity this summer, but then got down when he discovered that
she had zero interest in computers and even less in people who worked
with computers.  still she was pretty in a college girl kind of way, and
robert could even see himself pretending also to hate computers.";

^       ~yep.~
^       ~what kind you get?  wine coolers?  beer?~  she asked happily.
^       ~dr. pepper actually.~  he answered, to a now incredulous female.
^       ~uh huh.~  she nodded unconvinced.
^       ~it's true.  you see yesterday was my birthday.  i'm twenty one
now.  however, yesterday was sunday and i was unable to buy any booze.  
the day before i tried, but no one fell for my `i'm from australia'
routine.~
^       ~i see.~  nodded the still incredulous female.
^       ~what did you do this weekend?~  robert failed to asked.
^       ~me and my friends went up to the mountains, and...~ she held her
thumb and pinky out as she tipped her head back, signifying the
consumption of alcohol.  robert pondered this for a second and said:
^       ~you'er not twenty one yet.  you graduated a year after me, you
couldn't possibly be.~
^       while robert's innocent little mind tried to play social catch
up, something rather important to his life was happening right behind
him.  a tech by the name of bruce was fitting a part in to an
experimental piece of hardware.  his partner barney was watching
carefully, but they both failed to notice that the piece had been put in
backward.  they were more concerned with a frisbee formation called a
`stack' than actually doing quality work during the day.  work was hardly
important to them though because they were on company time and getting
paid by the hour.
^       they were technicians working on the trans fifth dimensional
transporter.  it was science right out of speculative fiction, so secret
at core that even the technicians working with the equipment didn't know
what it was they were testing.  bruce and barney looked down the metallic
hallway and saw at the end was a toy from the eighties which could change
forms between a semi truck and a robot (at the moment it was in it's
vehicle mode).  the two techs nodded at each other agreeing that it was
time.  barney pressed the green button at the base of the device.
^       there was a noise which followed that no human had ever heard
before.  it was a transporter rip and the closest description to a human
sound i can think of is a cat being run over by a snowmobile.  when the
noise stopped, bruce and barney looked at each other again, and then at
the toy at the end of the hallway.  nothing had happened to dear old
optimus prime.  they shrugged realizing that they hadn't actually
expected anything to happen and went about their business.
^       meanwhile, the female robert had been talking to turned her head,
wondering where the noise had come from.  she was about to turn her head
back and continue explaining how exactly one goes about obtaining beer
illegally, when she realized her audience was now gone.
^       ~hrm.  i wonder where he went off to?~  she asked the aether
around her.^^
