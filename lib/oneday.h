^        And when it was over, they refused to accept it.  They called
parental units and told them that they would be late getting home.  Not
much happened.  Nothing happened.  Nothing ever did.  Finally, with Robert
tired and ready to go home, he took Mary and Gary to their cars and drove
home. 
^        When he got home, he saw someone had left the light on for him. 
Robert turned it off.  He preferred it dark for some reason.  He went to
see if the parental units were still awake.  He could hear someone
stirring. 
^        ~You awake mom?~ he whispered. 
^        ~mmm.... yeah.... how was work toady?~ she asked him. 
^        ~You know, the usual~ he answered, ~how about you?~ 
^        ~You know the usual.  What about after work?  What did you do
then?~  She continued her questions. 
^        ~We went to FRIZ-~ he stammered, and corrected himself, ~bee.  It
was actually fun.  Gary and Harry were there.~  He explained, ~then we ate
dinner and hung out for a while.~ 
^        ~That's good~ Robert's mother said. 
^        ~Well, I'll see you tomorrow~ Robert spoke in the darkness.  His
mother was asleep and didn't answer. 
^        In the dark silence, he went to his room, changed and lay in his
bed.  He thought about Mary and could not sleep.  Maybe tomorrow would be
different.^

^	Silence.
